Herein is a command line MP3 player - m. Why should one exist? I like to lie on the couch and type parts of track names on the keyboard and have the media centre play that track.

Originally developed on Windows (Tao.FFmpeg) but runs on Ubuntu (GStreamer). Probably runs okay on Windows too. Not yet complete enough for a fancy release. This was developed for my own use, but feel free to use it for your own purposes, within the confines of the GPL.

I haven't touched this in a while. It compiles on Ubuntu with MonoDevelop, fails in Visual Studio. I couldn't be bothered making it build on both.
