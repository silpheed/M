Note about search terms:
All <term> terms are case insensitive. Extensions are not considered. e.g.
Term: track one
Will match: /music/Track one.mp3 and /music/Track twenty-one.mp3

Terms within double quotes (") are treated as a single term. e.g.
Term: "track one"
Will match: /music/Track one and a half.mp3 and NOT /music/Track twenty-one.mp3

Terms can be excluded with a minus sign (-). e.g.
Term: track -one
Will match: /music/Track two.mp3 and NOT /music/Track one.mp3

A minus sign directly after a non-space will not mark the term as an exclusion. e.g.
Term: track-one
Will match: /music/Track-one and a half.mp3

These basic search rules are similar to a Google search. e.g.
Term: track -"twenty-one"
Will match: /music/Track one.mp3 and NOT /music/Track twenty-one.mp3

Note about playlists:
Accepted playlists are: m3u, pls. Text (.txt) files consisting of newline-terminated filenames are also accepted.
